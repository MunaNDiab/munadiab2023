Task 12 :
Dont forget handling dividing by zero.
I guess converting part wasn't clear, 
as you should check if both or neither values exists, if so, return alert and error
if not, find which one you have and convert it to the other,
dont worry,
the important thing you get the concepet of converting
Good Job


Task 13 :
When the id is unavailable, the user isn't "not found", as there is no user to look for.
"user not found" when we have a valid id, but there is no data,
you can fix that by adding try catch block,
as if we insert id 12, id = data[i-1]['id'] triggers an error
we catch this error and output user not found
goes for both parts.
Good Job.
